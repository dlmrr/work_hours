README - Data Release 2 - April 12, 2017 
***********************************************

For exact definition of each data series and information on how we calculated these measures using the labor force surveys, please refer to our paper "Hours Worked in Europe and the US: New Data, New Answers" (Bick et al., 2017, April 12). Unless explicitly stated, all variables are constructed for the population 15 to 64.

Note that these data series are not sufficient to replicate the results from the disaggregate decomposition in Section 4 of the paper.
